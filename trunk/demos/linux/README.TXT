 Each of the subdirectories contain fully functional
 applications which have been designed around NASMX.INC
 file's capabilities. Each one demonstrates the usage of
 this collection for the design of Linux applications.
 Below is a list of all current demonstration packages
 and their function.

  DEMO1  - Demonstrates a basic "Hello, World!!!" program
           using the Linux Kernel SYSCALL mechanism.

  DEMO2  - Demonstrates how to access the command line and
           use the C library
  
  DEMO3  - Demonstrates accessing command line, environment,
           and procedural function usage

  DEMO4  - Demonstrates basic arithmetic operations

 All of these applications, as well as the NASMX.INC file,
 were completely developed and designed by Bryant Keller,
 Keith Kanios, and/or Rob Neff. As such, all rights over these
 files belong to Bryant Keller, Keith Kanios, and Rob Neff.
 You are permitted to use these demonstration applications and
 the NASMX.INC file as you see fit, so long as any source
 releases of your software gives us credit for our file.
 (basically, leave the NASMX.INC header alone)
