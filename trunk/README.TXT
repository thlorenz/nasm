~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Welcome to NASMX, a collection of macros, include files and
examples all built around the Netwide Assembler (NASM) for
all to use freely.

The project page is located at:

The community forum can be found at:

In this package, you will find 3 main directories and they
are as follows...

bin	- This directory is the primary location of all
          software utilized by the NASMX package. Please be
          advised that there is no DOS version of NASM with
          this package. The \bin\nasm.exe file is actually
          the 32-bit Windows version.

demos	- This directory holds various applications that
          demonstrate NASMX usage, very useful for learning
          NASMX. Please be advised, however, that these
          demos are far from complete/adequate programming
          examples and should not be substituted for proper
          assembly language programming tutorials. *NOTE*
          All file and directory paths found in the related
          demo files are relative to where NASMX is
          installed.

inc	- This directory holds vital include files needed
          by NASMX... PLEASE DO NOT ALTER ANY FILES IN THIS
          DIRECTORY!!!


That is about it. Please utilize all README.TXT files you
come across in this package. Enjoy :)
